Meeting Notes 2/25/20
First meeting.
Background knowledge:
	RNNs, data-augmentation (ex: even and odd time series elements), autoencoding

For the next week:
	1) Visualize data-> push to github
	2) We are going to be using PyTorch, so familiarize yourself with it if you need to
	3) Try to get a simple RNN working with the data

Next meeting tentatively set for 3/3/20 at 2pm.
