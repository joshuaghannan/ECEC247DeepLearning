We looked at the data and implemented an RNN.
It’s not obvious how to process the data and the RRN gets 25% accuracy- probs overfitting
We def need to make performance on testing set above random guess
	Need to analyze- is it data or architecture? 
	We’ll look at each separately
Architecture
       Split test data: 80/20 or 90/10  test/validation
       Adding layers
       Adding autoencoder for feature extraction
       GRU instead of LSTM
Data augmentation
	Sliding window
	Changing dimensions/ Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
       Fourier transform not that great, even and odd not that great but we should plug them in and see
Autoencoder
       Compress electrodes
       Deep AE
Eden and Jonathon: Come up with a few different data formats by Friday
Josh and Yiming: Make some improvements to architectures! 
We will also need to look at training and classifying 1 person instead of all people in the future which means we’ll need a specialized architecture for only one person
Next meeting is Friday at 2pm.
